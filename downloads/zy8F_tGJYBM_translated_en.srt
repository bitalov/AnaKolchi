00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:20,650
This is a story about Maryam who went

2
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,650
to the country and sang

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,650
Well, the one who loves is not self-love

4
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,650
Is there a calamity

5
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,650
You were in my hands and I let you fly, fly, fly

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,650
You reproach me, come back to me from

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:55,650
You were in my hands and I let you fly and burn, burn

8
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:05,650
O adultery

9
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:25,650
Today I'm leaving

10
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,650
My heart wants you

11
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,650
Who forgot you

12
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,650
You forgot everything that passed, my life did not buzz

13
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,650
The world was

14
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,650
I let you fly, fly, fly

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:02:00,650
O adultery, here is the wind

16
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,650
I let you fly and burn, burn

17
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:16,600
